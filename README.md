GM High Speed CAN Broadcast Arbitration IDs
==================================
This repository contains a DBC file containing CAN message definitions for the 
GM Global-A platform. Specifically, this DBC file was created to read broadcast data
from a 2007 Chevrolet Express, but it should work on most GM vehicles from the mid 2000s 
that use the GMLAN High Speed bus with 11-bit headers.
